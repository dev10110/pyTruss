# pyTruss
A simple python solver for truss structures, with mass optimization


pyTruss uses a simple linear pin joint structure solve method to solve arbitrary trusses.

The methods used were taught to me during Prof Pinho's lectures on Structures in the second year of my degree at Imperial College London.


# Usage

The file `truss.py` contains all the code needed. Simply include the .py file in your project, and call it by
```python
from truss import Node, Bar, Truss
```

# Example usage

The `Truss.py Example Usage.ipynb` jupyter notebook contains all the example usage and a quick guide to using this code.

The code itself is also carefully documented.
